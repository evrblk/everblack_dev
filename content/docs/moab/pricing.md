__$1 per 1 million enqueued tasks. Plus 1 million tasks for free each month__.

Simple as that.

Only enqueued tasks are billed. Does not matter how many times it was dequeued or retried. Does not matter if it was in
batches or not. Does not matter what was the size of the payload. Scheduled tasks are billed as all other normally 
enqueued tasks. That makes it simple for you to estimate the cost based on your load.

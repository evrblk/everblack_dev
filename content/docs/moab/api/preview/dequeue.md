title: Dequeue
type: docs

Picks up tasks from the queue. Only `ENQUEUED` tasks that have `scheduled_at <= now` are ready. If no tasks are
ready then an empty successful response will be returned. `batch_size` defines a maximum number of tasks that will
be picked up at once if that many is ready. Default is `1`.

__Note:__ This method is eventually consistent. Queues definitions are cached to reduce the load on control plane. So 
any change made by `UpdateQueue`, such as changing dequeuing settings, will be propagated here in about 10 seconds.    

Request:

```json
{
  "queue_name": "SquirrelQueue",
  "batch_size": 10
}
```

Response:

```json

  "tasks": [
    {
